  <p class="intro">
                &nbsp &nbsp In the next and the final evaluation most probably, we would try to end up with a working demo version of room with room modes active
    and try to demonstrate it with a small self made room, with LEDs and a few motors.
     Along with these, we would be having our sensors and voice recognition to make it look like google room.
   </p>
   <p class="description">
     The things to work upon is voice recognition technique for which we have found a solution, steve_computer_vision,
     in which we will edit the programmes to make it run according to our set of instructions.
     What we are waiting for is Raspberry pi, which is still to be provided by the council.
     We already have programmed a bit regarding sensor and voice recognition connecting to the electronic appliances.
     As soon as we have the hardware, it will take maximum of two days to make the model working of what we now see to make the automated room.
     Since we won't be provided with many hardwares, we try to arrange some and work upon them.<br></p>
     <p class='em'> Finally what we see our project to be like is: <p>
     <p class='final'> <ul style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
       <li>As soon as one enters the room during night time, light will turn on, and the opposite as well.</li>
       <li>A few predefined modes for room will aid the mood of the person inside, like party, study or sleep or DND even.</li>
       <li>The same voice recognition system will play music when said so, search on the internet and display it on the device connected to pi.</li>
       <li>And a lot of other internet related things that one sees in google now launcher.</li>
       <li>And a notificaion for every activity to our phone and laptops or anything with same pushbullet account.</li>
     </final>
